# Adventures of Avoranic
This is a text-based interactive game  that I'm developing right now. It's still a prototype - meaning it's still a work in progress - and its fate is unknown.
I started this coding project in August, 2024 and you can read more about it on my profile on itch.io: https://trixjoyce.itch.io

This project is in its early stage and not meant to be seen as a fully functional game quite yet. Because it's far from that...

<i>A shout out to the software Squiffy from textadventures.co.uk which is partly what I use for building this project. Even though I code a lot from scratch I use this software with some of the Javascript (but not all!).<i>
